### About me

Hi! I'm Alberto, a **Senior Unreal Engine developer** with **over 4 years of experience** crafting games and immersive applications. I love the technical side of development, but I also approach game programming with a design mindset, always considering how each mechanic or feature can enhance the experience we want to create. My passion lies in combining technical expertise with creativity to build engaging and responsive gameplay that resonates with players.

Beyond programming, I have hands-on experience leading and managing projects, from client-driven applications to internal tools, always striving for efficiency, quality, and innovation in every project.
